robvis is an R package that allows users to quickly visualise risk-of-bias assessments performed as part of a systematic review. It allows users to created weighted bar-plots of the distribution of risk-of-bias judgements within each bias domain, in addition to "traffic light" plots of the specific domain-level judgements for each study. The resulting figures are formatted according the risk-of-bias assessment tool use to perform the assessments (currently supported tools are ROB-2, ROBINS-I and QUADAS-2). An associated <a href="https://mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/robvis/">Shiny app</a> provides a user-friendly interface for the tool.
