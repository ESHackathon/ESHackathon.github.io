The ROSES forms were developed to improve the standards of evidence synthesis reporting and the transparency of the methods used for reviews and maps. The website (<a href="http://www.roses-reporting.com">www.roses-reporting.com</a>) aims to help adoption of the ROSES forms as well as improve the barrier to entry on using the ROSES forms in the least obtrusive way possible. In this project we've been working to improve the user experience, increasing efficiency and helping reviewers get the most out of the forms and website. We will be releasing the new version of the ROSES website shortly.
