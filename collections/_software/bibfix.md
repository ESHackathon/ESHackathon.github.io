bibfix is an R package and Shiny app that helps users repair and enrich their bibliographic data. It does so through a suite of functions that request bibliographic data from the OpenAlex API. 

Repaired fields can include titles, abstract, unique identifiers (e.g. DOIs), publication years, etc.

The Shiny app can be found < a href="https://estech.shinyapps.io/bibfix/" target="_blank">here</a>.
