metadat is an R package that collates and acts as a repository for meta-analytic data across diverse research fields (e.g., psychology, education, ecology, evolution). These data can be used freely for meta-analytic training to demonstrate concepts and complex analyses, re-analysis, and updating past meta-analyses. Meta-analysts from any field can contribute data and/or examples of data use.
