Systematic Maps are, according to the <a href="https://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/systematic-map">Environmental Evidence Journal</a>, “overviews of the quantity and quality of evidence in relation to a broad (open) question of policy or management relevance.” In simple terms, this means that documents are categorized according to the type, location, and publication information available for each work within a particular topic. Systematic maps are often used for environmental research, where it is particularly important to track the location of study sites. The spatial nature of a systematic map, particularly for environmental research, means that academics often use some kind of geographic map to analyze and present their information. Understanding the academic community’s familiarity with the R programming language, the team decided to build a webapp using R Shiny that could automate certain parts of creating a systematic map for environmental research.  

Using EviAtlas, a researcher will be able to shorten the time needed to generate key plots and maps of the previous work they’re analyzing. What might have taken a full days work in the past could now be condensed into about an hour. EviAtlas is still in development, and is open to pull requests.
