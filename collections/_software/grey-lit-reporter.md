In evidence synthesis it is relatively easy to find published literature on a given topic, and to record what the search string was used in which database, how many records were found, how many were used or not used and why. It is much more difficult to be systematic in searching and recording grey literature.

The Grey Literature Reporter is a Google Chrome extension that you train on the search results of the current website that you are on. It will then record the results – as JSON, CSV and potentially RIS – as well as the URL of the site and the search string used. With this extension you can easily start your search, click on the extension and tell it where the 1st result item is, tag all the relevant data in that result and automatically scrape the rest of the results and pages. Even if the markup changes for the site the next time you go to it will not matter as the extension is shown each time what elements on the page you’re interested in.
