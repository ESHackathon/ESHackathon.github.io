Systematic reviews should be described in a high degree of methodological detail. The ROSES reporting standards call for a high level of reporting detail in systematic reviews and systematic maps. An integral part of the methodological description of a review is a flow diagram/chart.<br> 

This package and the Shiny app allow users to produce a flow chart for their own review that conforms to ROSES reporting standards. Data can be manually entered or imported via a template spreadsheet.
