The third international conference of the <a href="https://www.environmentalevidence.org">Collaboration for Environmental Evidence</a> (CEE) - the <a href="https://environmentalevidencesummit.com">Environmental Evidence Summit</a> - was scheduled to take place in Ottawa from 1-5 June 2020. Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and associated closure of travel and public events, this event has now been cancelled.

We don't yet have any information on whether the conference will be rescheduled. Consequently, we have deferred our decision as to whether to cancel the event entirely, wait for a better time to host future in-person event, or host a virtual event instead. Once we know more, we will post that information here. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can contact us at our <a href="mailto:eshackathon@gmail.com">usual address</a>.
