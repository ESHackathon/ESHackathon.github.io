In June 2020, the third international conference of the <a href="https://www.environmentalevidence.org">Collaboration for Environmental Evidence</a> (CEE) - the <a href="https://environmentalevidencesummit.com">Environmental Evidence Summit</a> - will be held in Ottawa, Canada. In the lead-up to this event, we'll be hosting a short hackathon on 1-2 June to bring together thinkers and coders to consider the role of technology in evidence synthesis, and to chart new directions.

Like the <a href="/events/2019-04-canberra.html">2019 ESH in Canberra</a>, ESH Ottawa will have two streams: a 'discussion' stream to consider the evolving role of technology in evidence synthesis; and a 'coding' stream to work collaboratively on new or existing software projects. Participants will be free to form groups within or across streams to address the questions and problems that most interest them.

Unlike some of our previous events, the Ottawa ESH is unfunded, so we can't support travel or accommodation costs for potential attendees. What we can do is promise two days of stimulating discussion and creativity. Plus free catering. We're limited to 38 places, so get in quick!
