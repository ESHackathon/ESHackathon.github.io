We invite you to join us for the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon's online Evidence Synthesis & Meta-Analysis in R Conference (#ESMARConf), to  be held on January 21st and 22nd 2021.

The abstract submission system will be open until the 1st December 2020. Decisions will be made and applicants notified by December 14th.

<br>
<b>We are interested in talks that address any of the following:</b>
* Presentations of packages designed to assist reviewers across evidence synthesis stages, from planning to communication
* Demonstrations integrating evidence synthesis packages into an interoperable pipeline in R
* Novel applications of R packages in an evidence synthesis context
* Automating evidence synthesis in R
* Assisting novices to R in performing evidence syntheses with the aid of graphical user interfaces

<b>We encourage you to <a href="#submit">submit an abstract</a> if you have:</b>
* Developed an R package focused on some aspect of evidence synthesis (including systematic review, evidence maps, scoping reviews, rapid reviews) or meta-analysis (including quantitative synthesis methods like meta-regression, network meta-analysis, etc.);
* Combined multiple different packages in R designed for evidence synthesis or meta-analysis in a novel way; or
* Used an R package developed for other purposes (e.g. bibliometrix) in an evidence synthesis or meta-analysis.

<br>
