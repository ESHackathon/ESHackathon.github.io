We are delighted to announce that the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon physical hackathons return with ESH2024 again taking place at Newcastle University from 17th to 19th December 2024. We'll be bringing together a focused group of evidence synthesis and coding experts to develop state-of-the-art frameworks and tools for better evidence syntheses.

Our intention is to inspire and support the development of new ideas in this important field. By bringing together technologists and developers with subject-matter experts, participants will form new collaborations and develop new ways to approach critical problems. Attendees will work together to build software tools and research papers that will profoundly influence the field of meta-research.

We're incredibly thankful to our partners at Newcastle University and the Innovation Observatory for supporting the event, as well as generous funding from Evidence-Based Toxicology.
