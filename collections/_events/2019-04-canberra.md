The second Evidence Synthesis Hackathon was held at The University of New South Wales in Canberra, Australia from 8-10 April 2019. This event was a rare opportunity to meet and work with leading thinkers in the fields of evidence synthesis and meta-research, including speakers from all three evidence synthesis collaborations: <a href="https://www.cochrane.org">Cochrane</a>, <a href="https://campbellcollaboration.org">Campbell</a>, and the <a href="http://www.environmentalevidence.org">Collaboration for Environmental Evidence</a>.

Our intention was to inspire and support the development of new ideas in this important field. By bringing together technologists and developers with subject-matter experts, participants formed new collaborations and developed new ways to approach critical problems. Attendees worked together to build software tools and research papers that will profoundly influence the field of meta-research.
