Due to the cancellation of the conference of the <a href="https://www.environmentalevidence.org">Collaboration for Environmental Evidence</a> (CEE) - the <a href="https://environmentalevidencesummit.com">Environmental Evidence Summit</a>, we were sadly  forced to cancel our planned ESH event at that conference. Instead, we have been running a series of smaller, ongoing ESH projects throughout the year.

If you have any questions about getting involved in any of the ongoing projects, you can contact us at our <a href="mailto:eshackathon@gmail.com">usual address</a>.
