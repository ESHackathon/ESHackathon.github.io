Due to the cancellation of the conference of the <a href="https://www.environmentalevidence.org">Collaboration for Environmental Evidence</a> (CEE) - the <a href="https://environmentalevidencesummit.com">Environmental Evidence Summit</a>, we have sadly been forced to cancel our planned ESH event.

Instead, we will be running a series of ongoing ESH projects throughout the year. Find out more below. If you have any questions about getting involved in any of the ongoing projects, you can contact us at our <a href="mailto:eshackathon@gmail.com">usual address</a>.
