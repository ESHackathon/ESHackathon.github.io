We are delighted to announce that the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon physical hackathons return with ESH2023 at Newcastle University from 13th to 15th December 2023. We will be bringing together a focused group of evidence synthesis and coding experts to develop state-of-the-art frameworks and tools for better evidence syntheses.

Our intention is to inspire and support the development of new ideas in this important field. By bringing together technologists and developers with subject-matter experts, participants will form new collaborations and develop new ways to approach critical problems. Attendees will work together to build software tools and research papers that will profoundly influence the field of meta-research.

We're incredibly thankful to our partners at Newcastle University and the Information Observatory for supporting the event.
