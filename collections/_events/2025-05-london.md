We are delighted to announce that the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon will be taking place at UCL in London from 6th to 8th May 2025! We'll be bringing together a focused group of evidence synthesis and coding experts to develop state-of-the-art frameworks and tools for better evidence syntheses.

Our intention is to inspire and support the development of new ideas in this important field. By bringing together technologists and developers with subject-matter experts, participants will form new collaborations and develop new ways to approach critical problems. Attendees will work together to build software tools and research papers that will profoundly influence the field of meta-research.

We're incredibly thankful to our partners at UCL and the EPPI Centre for supporting the event.
