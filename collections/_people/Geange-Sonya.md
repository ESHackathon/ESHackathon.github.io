Sonya has recently submitted her PhD, and is working in the Division of Ecology and Evolution at the Australian National University. Her research mostly focuses upon the role of intraspecific variation and phenotypic plasticity in plant responses to global climate change. She is currently involved in a large systematic review of plant thermal tolerance, examining what techniques are used across ecological and agricultural fields, and if approaches differ depending on the biome or species under consideration.
