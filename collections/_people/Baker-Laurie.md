Laurie is a final year PhD student in Biology at the University of Glasgow. For her PhD she is using Bayesian state-space models to understand spatial and temporal patterns in disease transmission. During her masters and bachelors in marine biology she studied grey seal movement off the coast of Nova Scotia and the effect of management decisions on the Chilean pink cusk-eel fishery. Her interests are in spatial modeling and she's recently discovered the joys of text analysis and topic modeling.
