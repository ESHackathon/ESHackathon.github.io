Dr Matt Lloyd Jones is a microbial ecologist with an interest in the community ecology and evolution of bacteria. His current postdoctoral research in Dr Michiel Vos’s lab focuses on how microbes evolve antibiotic resistance in diverse microbial communities. As well as performing lab-based experimental evolution with sewage microbial communities, Matt is currently also working towards designing and testing everyday technological interventions for improved antimicrobial stewardship – such as the use of mobile apps.
