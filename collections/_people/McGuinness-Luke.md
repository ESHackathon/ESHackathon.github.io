Luke is an NIHR Doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Bristol Medical School, where he is attempting to integrate multiple sources of epidemiological evidence to improve our understanding of risk factors for dementia. He has extensive experience in evidence synthesis methodology, particularly in risk-of-bias assessment (<a href="riskofbias.info">riskofbias.info</a>). Luke is passionate about developing new tools to make evidence syntheses faster and more reliable and, despite pronouncing its name oddly, is a staunch advocate of R as a tool for reproducible science.
