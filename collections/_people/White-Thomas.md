Tom is a lecturer at The University of Sydney where he teaches and pursues research in evolutionary and sensory ecology. His work integrates experiments, fieldwork, and modelling to answer questions of adaptive evolution and behaviour, mostly using insects for their diversity and tractability. He also enjoys developing tools for open science, such as the R package <a href="https://tomwhite.io/software/">pavo</a> which facilitates the analysis of biological colouration and visual perception.
