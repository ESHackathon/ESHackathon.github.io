Yong is a visiting research fellow at the University of New South Wales. He is both a psychologist and biologist in training. His research involves understanding the evolutionary reasons for human facial preferences. More broadly, he is interested in theoretical issues concerning sexual selection, such as honest signalling and life-history trade-offs. He uses comparative meta-analysis to address some of these theoretical issues.
