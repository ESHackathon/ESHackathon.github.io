Matthew is a Research Fellow at Cochrane Australia, based in the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University. He holds a NHMRC Early Career Fellowship (2015-2019) and leads a programme of research on methods for evidence synthesis. His research interests include examination of the transparency and reproducibility of systematic reviews; methods to address reporting biases (e.g. publication bias, selective reporting bias); tools to assess risk of bias in randomized trials and non-randomized studies of interventions; and examination of selective inclusion of results in meta-analyses. He is leading the update of the PRISMA reporting guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and is an associate editor for the 2019 edition of the <a href="https://training.cochrane.org/handbook">Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</a>. He is also a co-convenor of the Cochrane Bias Methods Group.
