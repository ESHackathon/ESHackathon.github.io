Andrew is in the final stages of his DPhil in long-term ecology at Oxford University. He uses dendroecological, stable isotope, and mechanistic modelling techniques to address questions surrounding Arctic ‘shrubification’. Andrew became interested in evidence-based techniques through creating an evidence-map of the controls on Arctic shrub growth and expansion. With a background as a software developer (in Government, and as an intern at Microsoft Research), coding is central to all aspects of his research, particularly the application of functional programming and web technologies. Aside from his Arctic research, Andrew is also lead researcher on the Global Pollen Project (<a href="https://globalpollenproject.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">globalpollenproject.org</a>), which aims to establish a global pollen taxonomy.
