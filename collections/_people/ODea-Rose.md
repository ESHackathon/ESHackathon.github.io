"Rose is in the final year of her PhD at the University of New South Wales, in the Ecology & Evolution Research Centre. Rose enjoys using R to improve the reproducibility of her research, which tests for differences in phenotypic variance within populations. She conducts both lab experiments and meta-analyses, and is passionate about improving the ways research is conducted and disseminated.
