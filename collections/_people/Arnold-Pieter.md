Piet is a postdoc in the Division of Ecology and Evolution at The Australian National University, broadly interested in ecophysiology and the responses of plants or animals to climate change, be they tolerance, phenotypic plasticity, or evolutionary changes. He is currently involved in a large systematic review of plant thermal tolerance and has previously done systematic meta-analyses investigating relationships between metabolic rate and fitness in animals and for selection on thermal plasticity.
