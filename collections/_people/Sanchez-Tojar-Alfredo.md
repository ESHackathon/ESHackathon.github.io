Alfredo is a postdoctoral researcher at Bielefeld University (Germany). He is a behavioural and evolutionary ecologist using empirical and meta-analytic tools to study the causes and consequences of phenotypic variation. He is passionate about reproducibility and transparency in science, and a strong supporter of open science. His recent meta-analysis made him even more aware of how problematic publication bias is.
