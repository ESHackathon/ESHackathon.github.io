Sonia is a PhD student from the University of Glasgow and member of the Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health. Her main research interests focus on the measurement and interpretation of biological diversity. She has been involved in projects involving a wide range of applications ranging from an investigation of the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest biodiversity to a comparative phenotypic, genetic, and phylogenetic study of the transmission of antimicrobial resistance across sympatric human and animal populations. She is the author of the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rdiversity/index.html">rdiversity</a> package for R, which provides a framework for the measurement and partitioning of the (similarity-sensitive) biodiversity of a metacommunity and its constituent subcommunities.
