As the appreciation and need for timely and rigorous evidence synthesis continue to grow, so too will the need for tools and frameworks to conduct reviews of expanding evidence bases in an efficient and time-sensitive manner. Efforts to future-proof evidence synthesis through such Evidence Synthesis Technology (ESTech) have so far been isolated across interested individuals or groups, with no concerted effort to collaborate or build communities of practice in technology production.  

Here, we introduce a special series of papers on ESTech, and invite the readers of Environmental Evidence and Campbell Systematic Reviews to submit manuscripts introducing and validating novel evidence synthesis tools and frameworks. We welcome the submission of commentaries, methodology papers, and research articles that describe issues related to ESTech, or that introduce and validate novel frameworks, tools and techniques to support efficient and rigorous evidence synthesis. We hope this collection will help to consolidate ESTech development efforts and we encourage readers to join the ESTech revolution.
