The Evidence Synthesis Technology world can be complicated - tools can be hard to find, it can be difficult to know what skill level is needed, and they can involve a considerable learning curve. Here at ESH, we are trying to lower the costs associated with finding, learning and using new ESTech tools and frameworks. This blog series aims to introduce key tools that can help increase transparency, accessibility, efficiency and rigour in evidence syntheses. Each month, a member of the ESH family will introduce their ESTech, explaining its purpose, the background skills needed, and how it can be used to support evidence synthesis.
