Transparency is vital for repeatability and verifiability of systematic reviews, as with all other research. Authors of quantitative systematic reviews (i.e. ones that include meta-analysis) can maximise transparency by publishing the data they collected and the analytic code describing and documenting their analyses. This project will conduct a map of evidence syntheses to assess the degree to which data and code used in meta-analyses are made public by authors and journals publishing systematic reviews in environmental science and healthcare.
