The number of publications has been increasing exponentially, and as a result, so has the research field of evidence synthesis. Consequently, there is now a need to maintain the quality, currency and credibility of evidence synthesis approaches. Within this commentary, we aim to provide a vision for evidence synthesis as a fundamental tool for generating and guiding decision-making. This paper will be aimed at all stakeholders, including researchers, institutions, and the broader general community.
