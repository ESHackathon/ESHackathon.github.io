# Diversity & Equity Policy
Described herein, the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon (ESH) refers to an event series, consisting of in-person or online activities undertaken by voluntary groups of individuals (Participants). Participation is free and does not require any form of payment, though attendance at individual events may be limited to a specified number of Participants by the Organisers. Participants at ESH events are expected to contribute in a meaningful way to group activities. The Organisers are currently (as of 2020) Neal Haddaway and Martin Westgate.

## Aims and objectives of the Policy
The ESH is committed to equality and ensuring an accessible workflow, and equal and fair treatment of its Participants and others interacting with or at ESH events.

In the UK, The Equalities Act 2010 identifies a list of “protected characteristics”. It is illegal for an organisation to harass or discriminate against anyone because of their age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation. The Organisers of the ESH oppose all forms of unlawful and unfair discrimination and will not, through coordinating activities or by allowing or endorsing behaviour of its Participants in their activities associated with the ESH, discriminate on the grounds of any protected characteristics.

The ESH will seek to foster an accessible working environment free of discrimination and prejudice. All Participants will be treated fairly, with respect, and will be given equal opportunity in every aspect of their work within the ESH

## Accessibility
The Organisers will seek to ensure that ESH activities are accessible as possible to its Participants. To that effect, the Organisers will ensure the following:

- Communications will be primarily in writing in English, via email or online digital documents
- Participants will be encouraged to participate by commenting on and suggesting amendments to working documents, meeting minutes, and communications media (including website text and social media campaigns)

## Code of Conduct
- People will be treated with dignity and respect regardless of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation.
- At all times peoples feelings will be valued and respected. Language or humour that people find offensive will not be used, e.g. sexist or racist jokes or terminology which is derogatory to someone with a disability.
- No one will be harassed, abused or intimidated on the ground of his or her race, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, disability or age. Incidents of harassment will be taken seriously.

## Raising a concern/complaint
Any Participant or Organiser of the ESH who feels they have been treated unfairly on the grounds of a protected characteristic are encouraged to raise their concerns with an Organiser (anonymously, if desired). The Organisers will investigate the complaint, listening to all Participants involved. (If the complaint is against an Organiser, that person will not be part of conducting the investigation).

If the complaint is against a particular individual, this person will have the opportunity to express their point of view. The person making the complaint will also have this opportunity. If the complaint is against the ESH as a whole, the Organisers must work to ensure that such discrimination is not repeated in the future, and must inform the Participants of how they propose to do this.

Any decision to exclude a person from the ESH due to discriminatory or harassing behaviour will be made with reference to this Policy. The ESH will support people who feel they have been harassed or discriminated against, and will not victimise or treat them differently as a result.

## This policy
All Participants of the ESH will be notified of the Accessibility, Equality and Diversity Policy and that they are obligated to comply with its requirements and promote fairness whilst acting as Participants in ESH events. This policy will be monitored and reviewed on a regular basis (at least annually) to ensure that equality and diversity is continually promoted within the ESH.
