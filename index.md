Developing tools and technology<br>
for evidence synthesis
</em></div>
<br>
Evidence synthesis (ES) is the process of converting scientific outputs - such as articles, reports and data - into reliable and digestible evidence that can inform management or policy.  

ES is critical to evidence-informed decision-making in a range of fields from environmental conservation to medicine; but ES projects can be particularly time-consuming and resource-intensive.  

We believe that ES can be made more <b>resource-efficient, timely, transparent, rigorous and accessible</b> by developing and improving the ecosystem of available Open Science tools for effective synthesis.   

We created the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon (ESH) series to bring together interested researchers, practitioners and coders to discuss and develop new Open Source technologies for ES applications. Our events support the development of new ideas, software, and collaboration networks in this important field.
