# Developing tools and technology to support evidence synthesis

Evidence synthesis (ES) is the process of converting scientific outputs (such as articles, reports and data) into reliable and digestible evidence to inform management or policy. ES is critical to evidence-informed decision-making in a range of fields from environmental conservation to medicine, but ES projects can be particularly time-consuming and resource-intensive.  

We believe that ES can be made more resource-efficient, timely, transparent, rigorous and Open (i.e. accessible) by developing and improving the ecosystem of available Open Science tools for effective synthesis. To support this effort, we created the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon series to bring together interested researchers, practitioners and coders to discuss and develop new Open Source technologies for ES applications. Many of this Evidence Synthesis Technology (ESTech) takes the form of software, but we also tackle more fundamental issues where the developments are procedural or institutional changes. You can read more about what we mean by ESTech <a href="/misc/2019/01/17/what_is_the_esh.html">in this blogpost</a>.  

The next Evidence Synthesis Hackathon (ESH) will be held from 8<sup>th</sup> - 10<sup>th</sup> April in Canberra, Australia</a>. Registration has now closed, but you can find out more information about the event <a href="/events/2019-04-canberra.html">here</a>.

The inaugural ESH was held from 23<sup>rd</sup> - 25<sup>th</sup> April 2018 at the Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden, and was a resounding success. You can read about the outcomes in our <a href="/assets/docs/evidence-synthesis-hackathon-summary-report-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summary report (PDF)</a>, on our <a href="/events/2018-04-stockholm.html">outcomes page</a>, or view our <a href="https://github.com/ESHackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> repo to view software in development.
