# Developing tools to rapidly summarise research evidence

Evidence synthesis (ES) is the process of converting scientific outputs (such as articles and reports) into usable evidence to inform management or policy. ES is critical to evidence-based management in a range of fields from environmental conservation to medicine, but ES projects can be enormously time-consuming and expensive.

We think that we can make ES projects more efficient, and produce better results, by improving the ecosystem of available open science tools for effective synthesis. To make this happen, we created the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon series to bring together interested researchers, practitioners and coders to discuss and develop new open-source software for ES applications.

<strong>The next Evidence Synthesis Hackathon (ESH) will be held from 8th - 10th April in Canberra, Australia.</strong> Check out the <a href="http://evidencesynthesishackathon.com/canberra-2019/">event page</a>Â for more information, or <a href="http://evidencesynthesishackathon.com/eoi/">register your interest now</a>!

The inaugural ESH was held from Monday 23rd - Wednesday 25th April 2018 at the Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden, and was a resounding success. You can read about the outcomes in our <a href="https://evidencesynthesishackathon.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/evidence-synthesis-hackathon-summary-report-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summary report (PDF)</a>, on our <a href="http://evidencesynthesishackathon.com/what-was-produced/">outcomes page</a>, or view our <a href="https://github.com/ESHackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> repo to view software in development. The second ESH will take place in Canberra in 2019 to help participants to learn about evidence synthesis, meet fellow coders, and help shape research in this important field.
