Developing tools and technology for evidence synthesis
</em></div>
<br>

<div class="center">
Evidence synthesis (ES) is the process of converting scientific outputs - such as articles, reports, and data - into reliable and digestible evidence that can inform management or policy.
<br>
<br>
ES is critical to evidence-informed decision-making in a range of fields from environmental conservation to medicine; but ES projects can be particularly time-consuming and resource-intensive.  
<br>
<br>
We believe that ES can be made more <b>resource-efficient, timely, transparent, rigorous, and accessible</b> by developing and improving the ecosystem of available Open Science tools for effective synthesis.   
<br>
<br>
<a href="/2019/01/17/what_is_the_esh.html">We created the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon</a> (ESH) series to bring together interested researchers, practitioners, and coders to discuss and develop new Open Source technologies for ES applications.
