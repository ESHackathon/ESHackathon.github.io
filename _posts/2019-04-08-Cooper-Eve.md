<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="/assets/people/Cooper_Eve.jpg" alt="Eve Cooper"/>Eve is a PhD student at the Australian National University. She is interested in the evolutionary ecology of ageing. Using longitudinal data of wild animal populations, she is investigating the roles of life-history, the environment, and genetics in driving variation in ageing in the natural world. Eve recently published her first meta-analysis in Evolution Letters on the effects of early-life environment on late-life ageing in birds and mammals.
