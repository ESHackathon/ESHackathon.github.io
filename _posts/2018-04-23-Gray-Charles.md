Her role as a math-talking-doing-advocate grrrl is a relatively new career development, after spending almost twenty years working as a classically-trained pianist and music teacher. She lectures at La Trobe University, where she is undertaking a PhD in statistical data science and takes an active role in the Victorian branch of the Statistical Society of Australia.
