In 2009 he traveled to Silicon Valley to co-found Zappedy (since acquired by Groupon), and then in 2011 co-created Epistemonikos with Gabriel Rada, a non for profit that seeks to provide the best evidence in health. Today Epistemonikos is the world's largest systematic reviews search engine. He teaches about Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and programs in Python, Ruby and Node. XP (of Agile development) and Customer development are strong influences on his approach to software development.
