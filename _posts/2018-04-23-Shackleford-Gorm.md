He systematically reviews evidence for the effects of agricultural practices on soil, water, biodiversity, crops, and other variables. His academic training was not in computer programming, but he has increasingly been using Python (Django) to develop web apps, such as a crowdsourcing platform for systematic reviews of global catastrophic risks (<a href="http://www.x-risk.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.x-risk.net</a>) and a platform for meta-analysis that is now in development. He has used R extensively for meta-analysis, GIS, and statistical modelling. Before he started working in academia, he was a professional portrait photographer (<a href="http://www.gormshackelford.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.gormshackelford.com</a>).
