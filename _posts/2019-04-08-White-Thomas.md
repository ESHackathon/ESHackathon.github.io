His work integrates experiments, fieldwork, and modelling to answer questions of adaptive evolution and behaviour, mostly using insects for their diversity and tractability. He also enjoys developing tools for open science, such as the R package <a href="https://tomwhite.io/software/">pavo</a> which facilitates the analysis of biological colouration and visual perception.
